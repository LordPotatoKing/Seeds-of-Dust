One day as you wander through your underground hometown,
the ground begins to shake and rumble.
Rocks begin to tumble down the roof of the cave.
Seeking shelter, you run into a small hole along the edge of the cave.
Once the rampaging earthquake has subsided, you come outside to find that your only way back home has caved in.
You make your way around the cave, looking for a solution, only to find a staircase leading up to the world outside.

<<rm("rm_petrified_forest")>>


This is a strange new world.
There are noises you aren't familiar with, and lots of strange creatures, probably.
You might get eaten!
Suddenly, a drop of water lands on your head.
Then another, then a few more.
The roof is so high above you, and it's pouring water!

<<rm("rm_city")>>


You wander through this unfamiliar land.
Your feet hurt, and it's cold, and the roof is still upset with you.
You're wet, and you think you saw an animal.
You wish you were home.
Suddenly, you see something moving.
You're prepared to fight.
You've never fought anything before.
The creature reveals itself from the rubble around you,
and instead of a horrible creature, you see a familiar sight.

<<set_right_npc("Cheese")>>


You: Cheese! You made it out! Are you looking for a way home too?
Cheese:  I am. I think I heard that there's another entrance a few days West of here.

-> We should travel together then. We'll probably be safer that way.
    <<jump Meet Brooklyn, Cheese>>

-> That sounds pretty dangerous. I'm going to try to find another way, but good luck!

As you walk on, you're still cold and wet, but it is a comfort to have company.
Cheese's presence makes the walk more bearable, but you do worry about how the two of you will manage to find food.
The light changes as the two of you walk on, the already dark roof above you growing even dimmer and casting harsh shadows over the ruins of the city you approach.
You have cities underground, of course, but they don't look anything like this.
To your surprise, you see smoke rising in the distance, and you think you hear voices.
Just when you've decided you're imagining things, you see someone approaching.
How odd! You didn't think people could survive up here!

As you walk on, you do wish you had company.
But it's going to be hard enough to feed yourself in this terrible and hostile world, much less another person.
You need to worry about yourself.
You don't know how long you walk before you begin to approach the ruins of what must once have been a city.
You have cities underground, of course, but they don't look anything like this.

You have chosen a life for yourself that will be more harsh and dangerous than the one you once knew. 
You know you can't be sure that you'll see anything change in your lifetime, whether you make it a day or seventy more years,
and maybe you have doomed yourself to a life sowing seeds you will never see grow. 
But it is not meaningless.
You were told in your youth about how tall trees could stretch, but you know that they grew deep too, and you hope that someday, with time, patience, and care, 
the things that were buried will no longer remain so.

You remember hearing fairy tales in your youth about 'trees'. 
In the old world, they would stand tall, reaching miles above the ground. Some of them were high enough to scrape the ceiling of the sky. 
They would be covered in shades of brilliant green, like emeralds that grew along its skin. 
Based on what you see now, you wonder if those stories were ever true. 
The ground is scattered with what you assume are trees, but they look more like the stones that litter your underground world.

It's fascinating, but can't quite distract you from your rumbling stomach.
Every so often, flying creatures will flap in front of you, making strange noises. They must get food somewhere. Maybe you could follow one?

It's good to be home. The stalactites, the glow of bioluminescence, and the familiar drip, 
drip,
drip of water are all comforting. 
It's a miracle that you made it back alive at all, and you're infinitely grateful. As curious as the world above was, you know you wouldn't have survived. You think. 
And yet, 
your mind drifts back to the petrified forest, and the stories you were told in your youth. You wonder if there is hope for the world that once was, and as you walk back into the familiar darkness, you cannot help but wonder
just how far those roots go down.

Gardener: Someone in camp borrowed my hedge clippers, and they refuse to give it back. If you can convince them to give it back, I'll spare some food for your journey.

->Alright, I'll go talk to them.
    Gardener: Thank you. Good luck with this one. They're not exactly the friendly type.
    <<jump ClipperGuy>>
->Sorry, I don't have time for this.
    Gardener: Very well. Good luck on your journey. Brooklyn probably knows the way home. You ought to ask them.

Stranger:  The plants are the domain of the gods! We aren't allowed to lay eyes upon them until The Great Feast.
Stranger: In the days before the gods put us on this earth, the world was covered in green. The gods would consume this green, and it would fill their stomachs and give them strength.
Stranger: They called this strength "taste", a great sensation in their mouths that would provide them with their power.
Stranger: We mortals aren't allowed to share in this power until we have proved our worth, and are carried on to The Great Feast, where there will be endless food and endless drink, and we can share in the splendor of our creators for eternity!

->You know what? Just cut down the tree. I can't listen to this anymore.

how they will deliver our souls to The Great Feast, where we will finally experience the miracle of taste as the gods intended!
Stranger: The arrogant fool laughed in my face! Told me I was mad!
Stranger: He'll understand eventually. He'll understand when his soul is banished to The Infinite Starving, where his stomach will twist and churn in agony until the end of days!

You find it hard to believe people used to live like this.

You see a strange white vault. You approach to see faded text on it reading ‘refrigeraltar’. There’s also a note thanking Little Deborah, the mightiest god of the pantryon. When you touch the handle to try to pull it open, your hand comes away dusty, but the vault doesn’t open. You notice a rusted lock, and a ring of three keys hanging on the vault’s handle. Each has a different image hanging from it. 
->Pick the key bearing the image of a cheerful young woman wearing a blue dress and adorned with a halo
    You slide the key into the lock, and by some miracle, it turns. The door swings open. Inside is the strangest array of food you’ve ever seen. You pick a few of the squishy logs, and something covered in rainbow dots.
    <<set $food to ($food + 1)>>
->Pick the key with Colonel Sanders (placeholder)
    You try to slide the key into the lock, and some mechanism inside comes loose at the jostling. You’ll never be able to unlock it now!
->Pick the key with Ronald Mcdonald (placeholder)
    You try to slide the key into the lock, and some mechanism inside comes loose at the jostling. You’ll never be able to unlock it now!
