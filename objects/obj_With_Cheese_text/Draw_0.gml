draw_text(x,y, "As you walk on, you’re still cold and wet, but it is a comfort to have company. Cheese’s presence makes the walk more bearable, but you do worry about how the two of you will manage to find food.")

draw_text(x,y, "You approach the ruins of what must once have been a city. You have cities underground, of course, but they don’t look anything like this. To your surprise, you see smoke rising in the distance, and you think you hear voices. Just when you’ve decided you’re imagining things, you see someone approaching. How odd! You didn’t think people could survive up here!")
